# Installing linux on the CM4 with eMMC

The CM4 platform has a design limitation of a single PCI lane for storage. So if you have a CM4 with eMMC, you can't use the SD-card or the NVMe expansion slot at the back of the motherboard.
This also means you can't put an SD card in with pre-installed linux to image the eMMC. You have to use another matter of installation. This document provides the installation steps.

## Prerequisits

- Please have the rpiboot application installed on your desktop or laptop.
